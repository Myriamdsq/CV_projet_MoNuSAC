# CV_projet_MoNuSAC

This repository is a project conducted during a course of biomedical computer vision. It has been computed through google colaboratory environment and trained with the T4 GPU.

To compute the code the initial datset has to be retrieved from there: [Download MoNuSAC 2020 Data](https://monusac-2020.grand-challenge.org/Data/).
It has to be placed directly zipped on a folder called data_CV on your drive. Then the first code called Data_preparation will prepare the data for the training.

This new zipped file with data ready for the training has also to be placed on the data_CV foldet and then you can just run the modele notebook to obtain the trained U-Net model. The final zipped file I used for my training is also available in this repository (MoNuSAC_patches_0.25um_512).
